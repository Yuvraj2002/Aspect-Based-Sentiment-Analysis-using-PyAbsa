# Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis-using-PyAbsa
This script leverages the PyABSA library for aspect-based sentiment analysis. It uses pre-trained models to extract aspects and sentiments from input sentences. The results are then stored in a pandas DataFrame and saved to an Excel file with conditional formatting to highlight positive and negative sentiments.
