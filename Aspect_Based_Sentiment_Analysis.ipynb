So I called the garage directly and explained that I ' d like to come earlier if possible and got \" no problem sir , come along for when we open , and we ' ll get you straight in \" . . . did customer service actually speak with the garage , given how accommodating they were when I called , I doubt it ! 2 ) Different garage , and 4 tyres for my car . . . I had a very poor experience where it apparently took the garage 2 hours 10 minutes to change 4 tyres , and a very muddled experience from start to finish . . . they didn ' t have my paperwork , couldn ' t find my tyres , were questioning whether I was there on the right day , etc . and then the length of time to actually change the tyres , whilst mechanics floated aimlessly around the garage doing nothing .

            "[2024-06-09 07:27:04] (2.4.1.post1) Example 7246: I ordered a Dunlop SP Sport Maxx 255 / 45 R17 W ( 98 ) tyre for my Mercedes on the [ REDACTED ] website . As usual , I took a screen - shot of the ' Order confirmation ' screen showing these details for my records . Shortly afterwards I received an email confirmation from [ REDACTED ] which indicated that I had ordered a BMW Run - flat version of the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx . I rang to query this and although the sales person was very pleasant he seemed unable to accept that I had not ordered the BMW Run - flat version . Even after I emailed a copy of my screen - shot and then cancelled the order he still insisted that their ordering screen and systems are quite clear and that I must have accidentally ordered the wrong tyre . ( Sub - text ; another stupid customer ! ) I have since re - run my attempt to order this tyre and I suggest that [ REDACTED ] may benefit from re - designing their ordering screen and de - bugging their ' Order Confirmation ' screen . After you enter a tyre number ( AND the vehicle that the tyre is for ! ) , the order - screen offers a number of boxes in rows of three which feature various brands of that tyre size . The large , headline text of these boxes are the brand and the price then the classified name of the tyre ( in my case ' Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT ' followed by some generic ( and therefore worthless ) 4 and 5 - star reviews . Between the 5 - star review and the price is a narrow ruled - off area with one or more unexplained icons and logos . All the offered brands seem to have a tiny black car icon , presumably to indicate to the totally confused among us that the tyres are for a car rather than a bicycle or an airplane . Some of the tyres then have various car logos - BMW , Mercedes , Ferrari etc as well as ' Run Flat ' , and MO . There is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tyre with a BMW logo that makes it only suitable for a BMW , and how can that be anyway ? And if it is , why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a Mercedes tyre , which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen ? And if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn ' t it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained ? Then , having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle , why doesn ' t the ' Order confirmation ' screen include that fact ? If I hadn ' t checked the confirmation email carefully I could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car . So , if [ REDACTED ] want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don ' t need to .\n",

I had to wait an hour for me car and the garage didn ' t do the tracking I had requested with it . The only positive , and why I gave 2 stars and not 1 . Is they offered to do the tracking for free . Had to go back on Tuesday . I turn up on time as requested , but they are not ready , ask me to come back in 45 minutes . So I do that , have to wait around 30 minutes to get my car seen . At the end they only did the front tracking . So I had to go back again on Wednesday . This time I was seen within 20 minutes of arriving . But overall the service was not good .

The only other place I could find was [ REDACTED ] . com - they were offering good sport tyres next day at a very reasonable price to be fitted at the local HiQ garage . It seemed too good to be true , HiQ themselves charged more money and couldn ' t do it till the next Tuesday yet [ REDACTED ] could get the tyres to them for the next day for a cheaper price . The reviews looked good so I took my chances and it was all smooth sailing . The appointment was first thing the next morning , tyres arrived no problem and by 10am the job was done .

The car failed because the <tyre:Negative Confidence:0.9504> on the rear drivers side had been fitted the wrong way round ! ! Apparently the tyres are directional .

I have recently had tyres fitted at Tweeddale Motors in Peebles , my second visit through [ REDACTED ] and they are absolutely fantastic ! Friendly efficient and a pleasure to deal with . The reason for the poor rating is this , before my first visit to Tweeddale Motors I had arranged for a fitting in Penicuik . I went to get the tyres fitted and was told that [ REDACTED ] customers must leave the car for four hours after which the tyres will have been fitted ready for collection . I was unable to do this and said that I would have to return another day . Looking at the [ REDACTED ] website it stated that a queuing process would be in operation at this location , so I arrived at opening time a couple of days later , only to be told to collect the car in four hours time . Given the absence of customers and the information on the website I explained that I was unhappy with the service being offered and was told that if I did not wish to fit in with their procedure they would return the tyres which I agreed would probably be for the best . I spoke to [ REDACTED ] about this and , while very sympathetic and offering a discount on the price , they expressed no interest in including the fitting procedures in Penicuik on their website and indeed to this day it appears unchanged . I felt like a second class customer for using [ REDACTED ] in Penicuik , if the conditions were made plain on the website , I would have been able to make a different choice . Worse was the fact that [ REDACTED ] customer relations were not interested in addressing what I think is a real issue .

The first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn ' t arrived in stock in time . This was very frustrating as I wanted the new tyres for a road trip I was taking to Scotland . We arranged to have the tyres fitted the following Saturday AM . At 11 o ' clock that morning I received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn ' t received tyres from [ REDACTED ] ( not true ) and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead ( Sunday ) . I said yes . The next day the tyre fitters didn ' t show up and I received no call whatsoever . I called them at around 4 : 45pm . They said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening ? I spoke to [ REDACTED ] who were deeply apologetic and arranged for the tyres to be fitted the following Saturday . I asked them not to use the same mobile tyre fitter as I didn ' t trust them but they did . The following Saturday arrived and once again , no one showed . I called [ REDACTED ] who called the tyre fitters . Once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn ' t be able to get to me and asked if they could come on Sunday again instead . Obviously I told them where to go . In the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this Saturday . I went there and all appeared well . However when I collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off ! The tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn ' t actually apologise or accept blame . They said they will have a look at it this Friday . It ' s fair to say I have now given in . To be fair , throughout this whole situation , [ REDACTED ] customer service has actually been very good , especially from their call centre staff , and they have compensated me at each missed appointment . The problem is that there is a big issue with the tyre fitters they use / in general and I would not recommend whatsoever , having your tyres mobile fitted in the Leeds / Bradford area as this is the only mobile tyre fitter [ REDACTED ] use .\n",

Booking 4 new tyres for my Audi Q3 was easy and booked a time slot at their ‘ recommended ’ garage , so far so good . So turned up 15 mins before the due time as requested and walked in only to be greeted with “ the car wash is outside ” , after pointing out I was there for 4 new tyres was told “ oh sorry ” and asked for my name then to be told they were busy so there might be a delay . So not the greeting I would have expected and why give a time slot then not adhere to it ? Anyway there were two other customers in front of me in the waiting room when the manager came out and told them both exactly the same thing , their tracking was out but it can be rectified for a special price of £ 38 ( approx as can ’ t remember exactly ) . After the other customers had left the manager came out and gave me exactly the same pitch about the tracking , and the special price of £ 38 ( I check my tyres regularly and had not seen any signs of uneven wear ) so declined . . . . . . . . . call me a cynic but 3 people in a row all with exactly the same pitch about tracking ? Seems unlikely to me and a way of getting another £ 38 out of people . So after approx 1hr 15 mins I left the garage all completed and apart from the above all seemed ok . Not using the car that much due to a few days off it was parked up . 4 days & less that 75 miles later I got a tyre presser alert and on checking found all the tyres had been over inflated 42psi instead of 36psi . Moving on to 6 days later and around 150 miles later noticed that the F / N / S wheel has a nut missing , the locking wheel nut was gone so checked the others & found the F / O / S wheel had 2 x nut covers missing and the locking nut was loose and could be turned with your fingers . I immediately went to the garage and to be fare they ordered a replacement set of locking nuts without much quibbling and 90 mins later went back for them to be replaced BUT as they were a patterned replacement the nut covers did not fit so now I have the 4 locking wheel nuts without covers and one of the standard nuts without a cover . The managed did say he would order a replacement set and then get them to fit but why should I settle for second bast . My car was in purse to condition when I went in for the tyres and due to their error has left me with non standard locking wheel nuts and covers missing - not happy ! ! Overall the whole experience with this garage is poor to say the least and I would never use them again . Come on [ REDACTED ] this garage is doing you a disservice sort it out !\n",

            "[2024-06-09 07:27:04] (2.4.1.post1) Example 9398: [ REDACTED ] OK McConechys not OK . Ordered up my new tyres from [ REDACTED ] online , good price and good prompt service from [ REDACTED ] . However , I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy ' s , Sighthill , Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters . It is clear that as a [ REDACTED ] customer and not an actual McConechy ' s customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted , you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way . McConechy ' s fitted my tyres ( although I ' m very sure reluctantly ) . Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go , I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted . I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork . A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy ' s had not even changed the valve stems either . I contacted McConechy ' s about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone . I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems . I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted , so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated \" but I changed the valve cores though \" . I don ' t believe a word of that , what the tyre fitter guy doesn ' t know , is that I ' m a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it . Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps . Unfortunately I didn ' t notice McConechy ' s had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then . I know why he didn ' t change the valve stems , it is because they are all rusted up , badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over , maybe even some other problems that ' s why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal . I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted . That is not what I got . I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don ' t believe about the valve cores being changed . But that makes it OK doesn ' t it ? NO , it certainly doesn ' t ! Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm . Well when I checked them 50 miles later , the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels , the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far . I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place , more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun . There is no way the wheel nuts seen a toque wrench . The McConechy ' s tyre fitter was / is a story telling corner cutter . Avoid them , you are not a McConechy ' s customer , you are an annoyance to them , you are getting in their way . Not at all happy with any of this . Steven Dryden .\n",

My gripe though concerns the fact that having ordered and paid online for 5 tyres for my Land - rover , when the day came for them to be fitted I had rung up the previous afternoon to be told they didn ’ t have the tyres so the fitting wouldn ’ t take place . As it was a home fitting I ’ d taken the day off ! ! ! ! I was then told they could get four of the tyres for me by the following Tuesday and the fifth by the Friday . Great thought I . Well , I got my four tyres fitted on the Tuesday . No problem . Thursday afternoon came at at about 5 . 30pm I got an email from BC stating they couldn ’ t get my 5th tyre and “ how did I want to proceed ” . Livid ? ? ? ? Just a tad . I called BC but by then they ’ d closed for the day , so rang first thing the next day . Very helpful and polite lady understood my frustrations but went on to tell me that the tyre I ’ d ordered , paid for and expected to be fitted that morning couldn ’ t be obtained and BC didn ’ t know when they ’ d get some in .

I bought 2 pretty expensive tyres for my Merc CLS . I ’ d had Bridgestones on my summer wheels for over 40 , 000 miles on the rears . I ’ ve been running Winter Wheels and tyres and when I had to get my summer wheels back on and the rears replaced , I tried [ REDACTED ] ( BC ) . Having bought tyres online for the last 3 sets of tyres , I found BC to be the cheapest available for what is quite an unusual size . Add to this there was a 10 % off flash sale that day and the price was considerably cheaper than TyreLeader . The wheels and tyres were fitted by a local tyre dealer I know . Unfortunately when I got home , I realised that one of the tyres was not a Mercedes Only ( MO ) tyre . The difference between the standard tyre and the MO is that the MO tyre has a significant 2cm flange that protects my lovely AMG 19in rims . I often say that you only know what a company is like until there is a problem . The resolution of the problem is the mark of how good the company is . BC went above and beyond : I contacted BC and they were fantastic . As I work in London , and I ’ m busy at the moment , it took me a little while to get round to taking photos for BC ’ s reference . However , despite having travelled over 700 miles since fitting , BC have arranged for the tyre to be replaced with the correct one . Additionally , BC gave me a generous goodwill gesture as recognition of my inconvenience . I will not only buy all my future tyres from them , but I will also highly recommend them to my family and friends . If all companies treated their customers with the efficiency , courtesy and genuine desire to provide a good service , as BC do , the world would be a better place ! Well done [ REDACTED ] and thank you .\n",

Then I get an email informing me my chosen fitter is unable to accomodate my tyre size , fine but if so they really should remove them as an option when you buy that size tyre . I was offered another fitter further away probably the only one available that day but I did not wish to drive too far with a tyre that could deflate at any time , I tried to decline the suggestion but this was ignored and the booking made , I did not have the time whilst working to be messed about I gave up and requested a refund . I had time off the following week so I decided to try once more to get the tyres sorted only to be misled by the search engine metadata and my own eagerness for a bargain , I was in too much of a hurry and thought I had finally found a real bargain , I did not check properly and I bought a smaller size 18 inch instead of 19 inch . I noticed as soon as I got the confirmation email and sent an email requesting the size change and to cancel the fitting date . obviously I would have to pay the difference . An email arrived confirming the fitting time so I sent another email requesting contact , 5 hours later I got another email ( this is quick but seems like forever when you need something sorting ) the email informed me I wanted to change the tyres I had already bought to the same ones really ? why on earth would anyone want that ? again they are not reading emails , I responded correcting the mistake . The following day I had heard nothing regarding the change and the appointment was due that day , I then received a text informing me my appointment was due in 30 minutes . I sent another email asking for urgent contact . Hours later still nothing . I then spent around ten minutes on hold only to be politely informed that someone would phone me back in a few hours . They did as promised phone me back and finally I got a person who listened , I explained my mistake she quickly sorted it explained the extra cost and booked the day and time for me . The fitter Mckinnon Motors was great again really quick and courteous . It is such a shame a hassle free way of getting a good deal on tyres is marred by poor communication skills .

A terrible experience meaning I will never use A & S MOT Ltd again . Details of the issues are below . - Arranged and paid for two new tyres to be fitted and 4 - wheel alignment as rear tyres wearing on inside - Took time off work and waited at garage . Work done and was given paperwork . Wheels dirty - but as expected - Left for work and steering wheel off - centre when going straight - Got to work and checked values on paperwork . Rear out of alignment and before / after figures unchanged - Left work early and returned to garage . Told rear not adjustable and the only way to do it is to fit new parts - Arranged to bring car back next day to sort steering - Rang Audi to ask about part required etc . and was told that all settings ARE adjustable by any competent garage , both front AND rear - Went to another wheel alignment place and asked them to confirm . They put car on ramp and within 30 seconds said the same and they didn ' t even need any specialist tools etc . - Took more time off work to return to A & S as agreed . Told them my findings re adjustment and they said they would sort it along with the off - centre steering wheel - When finished told \" all done \" - given no paperwork . Asked for printout and once received checked it whilst there . Rear STILL not adjusted - Asked for an explanation . Wasn ' t given one but told I would need to bring it back AGAIN - I then went on ~ 100 mile journey on which someone almost drove into me . I checked the dash cam . Found out it had been moved to point at the sky . Reviewed the footage and it was an employee at A & S that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - I can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it - Cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one . Was also stuck on like glue . Took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove - Checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfIn summary , DON ’ T use this garage if you value your vehicle , time , money or safety .\n",

            "[2024-06-09 07:27:04] (2.4.1.post1) Example 10064: I ’ ve bought dozens of Michelin tyres from Costco ( very professional tyre - fitting ) but on this occasion I just wanted some mid - range tyres for 20yr old ( but 80 , 000 ) Volvo V70 T5 that we keep sentimentally along with the other car that my dad owned when he died 5yrs ago . Chose Kumho ’ s as I ’ d bought a 2nd hand BMW with these on a few years ago and they seemed OK . Existing Avon ( ZV - 7 ’ s ( ? ) ) only 20 % worn / 2 years old , but showing extensive micro - cracking to sidewalls . ( Incidentally : Seen this before on Avon ’ s put on the kids ’ cars , so consequently wouldn ’ t touch these again ) . Responded to customer satisfaction email from [ REDACTED ] commenting that jobsheet disclosed that fitters has seriously over - torqued wheelnuts ( 140Nm vs . 110Nn ) , suggesting they might want to look at their QC / spec . on this . By the time I got a response , requesting a copy of the jobsheet , it had become clear that one of the fitted tyres was not holding pressure , so advised this additionally , when sending copy jobsheet Invited to return to fitting depot to rectify . Unfortunately , return visit was an absolute object lesson in how NOT to deal with a customer service issue , particularly in a business where the customers need to be assured of the professionalism of the service with which they are being provided , not least because it impacts directly on their safety . So : - ( Manager ) Don ’ t moan to me as soon as I arrive that you ’ ve “ been dealing with nothing but problems all day ! ” . I don ’ t care . I just want you to do what should have done properly with my car in the first place . - ( Fitter ) Crack the wheel nuts off with the tyre on the ground , not against the auto gearbox - “ Park ” . This is car DIY , page 1 . Unbelievable ! - ( Manager ) Don ’ t tell me that “ often old cars leak from the rims ” , inferring there ’ s nothing to be done in that case . I drove more than a million miles a bought maybe a hundred tyres before you were even born sonny and know perfectly well that there will often be slight corrosion on the bead seat of even a very new alloy wheel , and this is capable of compromising the integrity of the air seal . Any tyre fitter who knows his salt will inspect the rim , note this , and , as necessary , wire brush or even file this smooth . - ( Manager ) When faced with my sceptical look about “ leaky rims ” , don ’ t then pathetically backtrack and suggest kerbing , or a pothole as the culprit ( what , in the 20 miles since fitting ? ! ) The rim was not inspected and properly prepared for fitting and that ’ s all there is to it . - ( Fitter ) Tighten the wheenuts down in a star pattern , not a circle . And do the same with each of the nuts . Just because there are 5 , you don ’ t have to forget to torque down the 5th ! I watched you ! - ( Fitter ) Having been told the other wheel remains over - torqued to 140Nm where ’ s the spec is 110 , don ’ t check it with your torque wrench set at 110Nm and then tell me it ’ s OK - you need to loosen the nuts off first and then do it again properly , to the correct torque ! God Almighty ! They ’ ve had their chance , and another , so suffice it to say I will not be darkening their doorstep again . It ’ s a shame , because their choice of tyres is good and sometimes you just need something respectable , mid - range , not ultra - premium , in a tyre . It would never happen , because their prices for the latter , e . g . Michelin , are higher than Costco , but theoretically I could have been going to [ REDACTED ] and spending £ 1200 + on 4 tyres for one of my other cars , not £ 150 on 2 . . . And would it have been amateur night on that visit also ? I ’ m sorry to say that I think so . . .\n",
